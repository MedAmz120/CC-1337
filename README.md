# CC-1337
# 🚀 42 Network Projects

This repository gathers several projects completed during my journey at **1337 | UM6P** (part of the 42 Network).  
Each project was an opportunity to dive deep into **low-level programming, system design, algorithms, and software engineering principles**.

## 📌 Projects  

- **[libft](./libft/)** – Implementation of a personal C standard library.  
- **[get_next_line](./get_next_line/)** – Function to read a line from a file descriptor.  
- **[printf](./printf/)** – Re-implementation of the standard `printf` function.  
- **[push_swap](./push_swap/)** – Sorting algorithm challenge using stacks with the least operations possible.  
- **[so_long](./so_long/)** – 2D game using MiniLibX library.  
- **[minitalk](./minitalk/)** – Simple client-server communication using UNIX signals.  
- **[philosophers](./philosophers/)** – Dining philosophers problem: process synchronization and multithreading.  
- **[minishell](./minishell/)** – Shell recreation with pipes, redirections, and built-in commands.  
- **[cub3d](./cub3d/)** – 3D raycasting engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D.  
- **[ft_irc](./ft_irc/)** – Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server with multiple client support.  
- **[cpp_workstation](./cpp_workstation_git/)** – Intensive C++ modules covering OOP, inheritance, templates, STL, and more.

## 🎯 What I Learned  

- **C programming mastery**: memory management, pointers, data structures.  
- **Algorithms & optimization**: sorting, searching, complexity analysis.  
- **System programming**: processes, signals, threads, synchronization.  
- **Unix environment**: system calls, file descriptors, process control.  
- **Shell & scripting**: building a working shell from scratch.  
- **Computer graphics**: raycasting, event handling, game loops.  
- **Networking**: socket programming and server-client architecture.  
- **C++ fundamentals**: OOP, templates, STL, advanced memory handling.

## 🧠 Skills Gained  

- Problem-solving and debugging under strict constraints.  
- Writing clean, maintainable, and modular code.  
- Collaboration and peer code review (essential at 42).  
- Adaptability to new technologies and paradigms.
